# Engage!

This folder contains the items needed to build the binding between node.js and the Engage Engine.  In general, you should obtain the pre-built package from npm by:

```
npm install engage-engine
```

However, if you want to build a package of your own, or change the code for the binding, feel free to do it here.  The best way to do this is ro run the **publish-to-npm.sh** script.
